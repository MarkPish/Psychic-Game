JS Homework - The Pyschic Game

    This project is my first attempt to create a guess the random letter computer game, known here as "The Psychic Game".
    
    Like many students of coding before me, there is a sense of horror when given new homework assignments. I found that this assignment was much more manageable, as simplistic as it is, by actually doing the pseudocoding in detail.....how do you eat an elephant?.....one bite at a time!

    To begin with the game....
    Select a letter to see if your choice matches the computer's....remember:  you get 9 chances to win....
    Win and the counter resets and you begin again with a new random letter selection to try and match in 9 turns, while adding to your win total.
    Lose after 9 attempts and the computer selects another letter while adding to your loss total.

    I will be checking back periodically and adding more details as my knowledge in the codiong field increases. 

    Any comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated......haha...I need all the help I can get!
